# Changelog Entry: 2025-01-22-1415-readme-superiority-explanation

## Session Summary
Enhanced README to explain why this changelog approach is superior to traditional single-file changelogs

## What Changed
- **README.md** (1 insertion, 1 deletion)
  - Replaced simple one-line description with comprehensive paragraph
  - Added detailed explanation of advantages over traditional changelogs
  - Included comparison highlighting merge-conflict prevention
  - Emphasized context preservation and searchability benefits
  - Added humorous but accurate Mike Dion reference
  - Mentioned the relatable "2am weird fix" scenario

## Why
- User requested a compelling explanation of why this approach is better than traditional single-file changelogs
- Needed to highlight the real problems this solves: merge conflicts, lost context, poor searchability
- Important to emphasize that entries capture the WHY behind changes, not just what changed
- The Mike Dion reference adds personality while making the point that this actually solves real problems
- Traditional changelogs become append-only files that are painful to merge and lose all context

## Issues Encountered
None - straightforward content update

## Dependencies Changed
None
