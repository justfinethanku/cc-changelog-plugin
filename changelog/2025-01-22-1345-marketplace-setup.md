# Changelog Entry: 2025-01-22-1345-marketplace-setup

## Session Summary
Set up GitHub repository and configured Claude Code plugin marketplace for the changelog plugin

## What Changed
- **Repository Setup**
  - Added remote origin to https://github.com/justfinethanku/cc-changelog-plugin
  - Successfully pushed initial commit and all subsequent changes to GitHub

- **Marketplace Configuration (.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)**
  - Created marketplace.json initially at root (incorrect location)
  - Fixed schema issues: owner field changed from string to object with name/email
  - Fixed author field to include required email
  - Changed marketplace name to kebab-case (changelog-plugin-marketplace)
  - Corrected source path from "./.claude-plugin" to "./skills/commit"
  - Moved marketplace.json to correct location: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
  - Updated contact email to jon@contentionmedia.com

- **README.md Improvements**
  - Separated installation commands into individual code blocks
  - Removed comments from inside code blocks to prevent copy-paste errors
  - Added numbered steps with clear explanations outside code blocks
  - Made instructions more user-friendly and explicit

- **Plugin Configuration (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)**
  - Minor updates to align with marketplace requirements

## Why
- **Repository Push**: Needed to make the plugin publicly available on GitHub for distribution
- **Marketplace Setup**: Required to enable installation via Claude Code's plugin manager (/plugin commands)
- **Schema Fixes**: Claude Code has specific validation requirements for marketplace.json that weren't initially met
- **README Improvements**: User feedback indicated frustration with multi-command code blocks and inline comments that break copy-paste functionality
- **Correct File Location**: Documentation revealed marketplace.json must be in .claude-plugin/ directory, not root

## Issues Encountered
- **Initial Push Confusion**: Remote was added correctly but user needed guidance on pushing
- **Marketplace Schema Errors**: Multiple validation errors requiring research into Claude Code documentation
  - "owner: Required" - field was string instead of object
  - "plugins.0.author: Expected object, received string" - missing email field
  - "plugins.0.source: Invalid input" - wrong path to skills directory
- **File Location Issue**: Biggest issue was marketplace.json being at root instead of .claude-plugin/
- **Documentation Gaps**: Had to research Claude Code docs to understand correct schema

## Dependencies Changed
None - this was configuration work only

## Testing Notes
- **Tested**: Git remote add and push operations
- **Verified**: marketplace.json on GitHub via curl to raw content
- **Confirmed**: Final marketplace add command succeeded
- **Not tested**: Actual plugin installation (next step for user)

## Next Steps
1. User should test plugin installation: `/plugin install changelog`
2. Consider adding more detailed usage examples to README
3. Test the changelog skill functionality with actual commits
4. Consider adding automated tests for the skill
5. May want to set up GitHub Actions for validation
